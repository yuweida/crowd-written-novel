# Github Crowd Written Novel (Title pending)

The idea is fairly simple: We use the Github workflow to crowd-write a novel. I originally had a structure in place, such as how many chapters, how many characters (both literally and figuratively), and so on, but that seemed a little too much. As such, this is an open experiment with hardly any structure.

## How It Works

Send me pull requests, and we collectively decide what improvements each needs and which of it will make to the story line.

Your contributions don't have to be long, in fact even a small sentence is acceptable.

Pull requests do not have to be about the story line; they could also suggest tips on how to improve this process. We can then refine this README. In fact I'd reckon we need a lot of improvements to the process, since I abandoned my own structure in favor of one that naturally shapes up as we go about this.

I started with a very simple line: "It was a sunny May day". Your turn.
